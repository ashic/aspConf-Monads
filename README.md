aspConf-Monads
==============

Code for my aspConf 2012 session on Monads. [http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/aspConf/aspConf/Understanding-Monads-with-JavaScript]

Notes
-----

1. The JS bit is "end product" of live coding. Check out the first portion of the video for details.
2. The C# project was built with VS2012 RC. The code should run with VS2010, but I haven't checked.
3. The JS code is run in index.html. Use a debugger (like the one in Chrome Dev Tools or FireBug) to see what's going on (I'm using the Chrome Dev Tools in the video).
